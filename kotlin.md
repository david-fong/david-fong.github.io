# Thoughts on Kotlin

At this point in time, I haven't used it yet, but here are the main things that I love about it, which I would list as top reasons to convince someone else to look into it:

- Nullability is ingrained in the type system. No annotation shenanigans like Java.
- Terse, same-character-length variable-declaration keywords differentiating reference-reassignability: var and val. In Java, the verbosity of the final keyword almost feels like a punishment.
- Supports using named function arguments.
- Toplevel functions and variables. No everything-must-go-in-a-class nonsense like Java.
- Ability to declare multiple classes in one file.
- Better syntax for generics and covariance, contravariance, invariance.
- The basic standard library classes are all imported by default.

To sum it up, Kotlin has all the benefit of hindsight and good new ideas. It interoperates with Java, which is just stellar.

There's probably more that I would love that I just haven't read about yet. I'd love to try it out, but I don't really have a project idea that it would make sense to use Kotlin for at the moment.
