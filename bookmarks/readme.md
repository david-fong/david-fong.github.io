These documents contain links that I at one point found useful or interesting to read, and that I wanted to bookmark- usually because they _aren't_ the kind of websites I will visit on a regular basis for my day-to-day programming tasks.

It is not very well organized. You are welcome to wade through it if you are curious. If you do, I hope and wager that you will also find something interesting that you didn't know before. Happy reading!
